so we can always get back to the last version easily.    Greg can get access to these files, make updates, push to github.     Then copy / paste the html into the forum posts.

1 go to github repo or open in Code or DW

2 find the file that corresponds to the forum post

3 make necessary updates to file in ide

4 same file

5 commit file

6 push file

7 copy html from ide and paste into forum post

there will be a readme file in each folder explaining what the files are all about and where they are displayed on the website.    in each file or readme will be a link to the correct forum post.    Greg might have this all figured out, but if he is the only one and he goes on vacation - others should be able to navigate putting up new content in his absence.
